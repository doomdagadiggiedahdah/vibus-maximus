# Machine Learning

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems that learn from data. It allows computers to improve their performance on a task without being explicitly programmed.

## Key Concepts

- **Supervised Learning**: Training with labeled data
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Finding patterns in unlabeled data
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning through interaction with an environment
- **Deep Learning**: Using neural networks with multiple layers

## Common Algorithms

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines
- Neural Networks
- k-Means Clustering

## Applications

Machine learning is used in recommendation systems, image recognition, natural language processing, autonomous vehicles, and many other fields.

## Libraries and Frameworks

- TensorFlow
- PyTorch
- scikit-learn
- Keras
