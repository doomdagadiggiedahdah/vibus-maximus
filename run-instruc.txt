‚óè We've implemented a complete t-SNE analysis and visualization system for Obsidian notes! The system includes:

  1. TypeScript Obsidian Plugin:
    - Settings panel for t-SNE parameters
    - Custom visualization view
    - Integration with the Python backend
    - Interactive UI with status updates
  2. Python Backend:
    - Flask server that receives notes and processes them
    - TF-IDF vectorization of note content
    - t-SNE dimensionality reduction
    - DBSCAN clustering to automatically identify note clusters
    - Extraction of important terms for each note and cluster
  3. Interactive Visualization:
    - Canvas-based visualization with zooming and panning
    - Color-coded note clusters
    - Cluster detection and labeling
    - Tooltips with note information and keywords

  To run the system:

  1. First, start the Python server:
  python src/python/tsne/server.py
  2. Then build and load the Obsidian plugin:
  npm run build
  # Then load in Obsidian
  3. In Obsidian, run the "Open t-SNE Visualization" command to open the visualization view.
  4. Click the "Run Analysis" button to analyze your notes and see the t-SNE visualization.

  The visualization will show your notes as points in a 2D space, with similar notes clustered together. Colors indicate different clusters, and hovering over a point shows details about the note including
  its top keywords and cluster information.

  Would you like me to explain any specific part of the implementation in more detail?
