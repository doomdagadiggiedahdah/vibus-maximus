# Sidewalk Crack Pattern Analysis: Block 7

My systematic documentation of sidewalk crack patterns has revealed statistically improbable regularities that cannot be explained by standard concrete degradation. The cracks along Oak Street form precise 37-degree angles at every intersection and maintain consistent 7.3-inch spacing despite varying weather conditions and foot traffic. Most compelling evidence: mapped 317 cracks across 3 neighborhoods and when connected according to my algorithm, they form what appears to be an accurate star chart showing the Cassiopeia constellation as it will appear in exactly 237 years. The newest sidewalk section poured last month developed cracks within 24 hours that perfectly extend the pattern from adjacent sections, suggesting some force is actively guiding crack formation. I've begun testing if stepping on cracks affects the pattern development â€“ preliminary results remain inconclusive but my mother reports no unusual back pain.
