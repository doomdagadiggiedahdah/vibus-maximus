# Toast Pattern Analysis: Day 43

The burn patterns on my morning toast continue to display statistically improbable regularities. Today's pattern clearly resembled the constellation Cassiopeia, making it the seventh consecutive day of celestial formations. I've been photographing each slice and creating a time-lapse animation â€“ when played backward at 2.5x speed, the patterns seem to form a rudimentary map of what might be an underground tunnel system. Switched bread brands last week but the patterns persisted, eliminating the "artisanal bakery conspiracy" theory. Beginning to suspect my toaster may have been manufactured at the same factory that makes those SETI radio telescopes.
