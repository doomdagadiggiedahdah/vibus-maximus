# My Alternative Calendar System: Month 7

Seven months into using my self-designed 13-month calendar with each week containing 6 days of 28 hours, and I'm experiencing remarkable productivity improvements. By ignoring conventional time, I've eliminated the artificial construct of "Monday blues" and replaced it with "Quirkday enthusiasm." Most people don't notice I'm operating on a different temporal system, though I occasionally have to explain why I show up to Thursday meetings on what they call "Wednesday." The cat has fully adapted to the new feeding schedule but seems confused about when birds should appear at the window. Most challenging aspect: finding an app developer willing to create a custom calendar that includes my new month, "Wondertober," which exists between July and August.
