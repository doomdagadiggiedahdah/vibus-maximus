# Unconventional Recipe Experiment #42: Toothpaste Cuisine

Today's culinary experiment involved incorporating small amounts of toothpaste as a flavor enhancer in conventional recipes. The mint-chocolate chip cookies were a qualified success, though guests reported a slight numbing sensation that persisted for 3.7 hours. The toothpaste-infused scrambled eggs experiment was a catastrophic failure that resulted in what can only be described as "morning breath in solid form." Most successful application: 1/8 teaspoon of whitening toothpaste added to vanilla pudding created an unexpected flavor profile one test subject described as "winter wonderland meets confused dairy." Unexpected side effect: all experimental dishes leave dishware noticeably cleaner than standard soap can achieve. Next trial will explore the culinary applications of different dental floss flavors as a garnish.
