# The Disappearing Object Phenomenon: Case #37

Documented another instance of the Disappearing Object Phenomenon today – keys vanished from kitchen counter despite no one entering apartment. The objects always reappear exactly 17 hours later in implausible locations (previous instances: inside sealed cereal box, balanced on top of ceiling fan, frozen inside ice cube). Most perplexing pattern: objects only disappear if directly mentioned in conversation within 3 minutes of last touching them. I've begun testing this hypothesis by deliberately mentioning random objects – success rate: 43%. Current theory involves microportals opening based on sound vibration frequencies specific to object names. Most concerning development: my research notebook documenting all previous disappearances vanished mid-documentation and returned with what appears to be additional notes written in my handwriting but with unfamiliar vocabulary and references to events I don't recall.
