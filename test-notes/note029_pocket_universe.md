# Pocket Universe Discovery: Day 7

I've confirmed the existence of a pocket universe inside my jacket's left pocket. Small objects placed inside consistently emerge subtly altered: paperclips return slightly warmer, coins come back with dates advanced by exactly 3 years, and pens return with ink colors shifted precisely one position on the color wheel. Most remarkable observation: a rubber ball I left in overnight came back orbited by 7 microscopic rubber satellites. I've installed a tiny camera but the footage shows only an unusual purple haze. Have started leaving small notes with questions â€“ this morning found one returned with what appears to be an answer written in reverse microscopic script that reads "WE ARE THE POCKET PEOPLE, TIME WORKS DIFFERENTLY HERE, SEND MORE LINT."
