# Elevator Music Mind Control Research

I've been analyzing the elevator music in my office building and have identified subliminal messaging patterns embedded in the seemingly innocuous smooth jazz. When the standard muzak version of "The Girl from Ipanema" plays, 73% of elevator occupants check their phones within 17 seconds – this cannot be coincidence. Most compelling evidence: on days when the system plays songs in E minor, corporate email volume increases by 42%, while days with predominantly C major selections correlate with 37% more coffee consumption. I've begun bringing a portable frequency analyzer into the elevator – discovered ultrasonic tones embedded at precisely 17,437 Hz that are not present in the original recordings of these songs. After three weeks of exposure to these tones, I've noticed myself inexplicably craving the salads from the 3rd floor cafeteria that I previously disliked.
