# Sleep Position Knowledge Absorption Theory: Test #17

My hypothesis that sleep position affects knowledge retention continues to yield fascinating results. Three consecutive nights sleeping in a perfect north-south alignment with my head elevated at precisely 17 degrees resulted in unexplained improvements in my French vocabulary despite no conscious study. Sleeping in a curled position resembling the Fibonacci spiral led to solving a complex math problem that had stumped me for weeks. Most unexpected result: the one night I accidentally slept with my right arm extended precisely 90 degrees from my body, I woke up with detailed knowledge of 17th-century Dutch shipping routes. I've begun testing if book placement under the pillow affects information transfer â€“ preliminary results indicate non-fiction works better than fiction, with maritime history showing highest absorption rates.
