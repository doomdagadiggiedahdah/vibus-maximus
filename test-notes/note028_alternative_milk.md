# Alternative Milk Research: Breakthrough

After 17 failed attempts, I've successfully created what I believe to be the world's first pickle-based milk alternative. The brine fermentation process yields a surprisingly creamy texture, though the distinctive aroma remains a challenge. Initial blind taste tests with reluctant friends resulted in three new ex-friends and one potential investor. The liquid maintains stability in coffee but causes immediate curdling when exposed to direct sunlight â€“ an unexpected photosensitive reaction I'm calling "dillumination." Most promising application: makes exceptional dill-flavored ice cream that changes color based on the eater's body temperature. Current challenge: finding a less alarming name than "Dilk" for commercial packaging.
