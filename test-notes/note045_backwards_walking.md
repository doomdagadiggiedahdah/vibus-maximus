# Backwards Walking Experiment: Day 9

Day 9 of my experiment walking backwards everywhere continues to yield unexpected neurological benefits. Spatial awareness has improved by approximately 37% based on my obstacle course metrics, and dream recall has inexplicably increased to near-photographic levels. Most surprising development: have begun experiencing occasional moments of prescience â€“ arrived at bus stop 17 seconds before unscheduled early bus arrival that I couldn't possibly have anticipated. Public reactions remain mixed: fellow commuters give wider berth (advantageous during flu season), while the barista at my regular coffee shop has started preparing my order when I enter backwards through the door despite never having told her my usual order. Side effects include moderate neck strain and a curious tendency to speak in reverse word order approximately 7% of the time. Next week will attempt backwards walking while listening to music played in reverse to test for enhanced effects.
