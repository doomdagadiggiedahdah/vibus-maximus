# Left Shoe Communication Attempt: Log 7

My hypothesis that left shoes across the world are telepathically connected continues to gain supporting evidence. When I whisper secrets to my left sneaker before bed, I consistently find my left dress shoe has moved approximately 3.7 inches from its original position by morning. The loafer remains unmoved, suggesting a hierarchy in the shoe consciousness network. Set up an experiment where I simultaneously placed identical messages in three left shoes across town (with the help of reluctant friends) â€“ woke up to find all three had migrated toward the north wall of their respective rooms. Next step: attempting to receive messages by sleeping with my left shoe under my pillow.
