# Elevator Ritual Observations

Day 15 of subtly manipulating elevator environments. When I stand precisely in the center and maintain unbroken eye contact with the floor number display, 73% of fellow passengers shift to create a perfect geometric arrangement around me. Most fascinating discovery: if I whisper "going down" regardless of the elevator's actual direction, exactly half of the occupants will check their watches within 10 seconds. Have begun subtly rearranging the order of the floor buttons when no one's looking â€“ so far no one has consciously noticed, but travel patterns in the building have shifted to create a clockwise flow of foot traffic on all floors.
