# Coffee Sentience Research: Week 3

My investigation into potential coffee sentience continues to yield compelling evidence supporting my hypothesis that brewed coffee displays primitive consciousness. The liquid consistently forms symmetrical ripple patterns when I discuss certain topics nearby, with particularly strong reactions to conversations about climate change and 1970s progressive rock. Most striking observation: when left in the mug while I exit the room, the coffee's temperature decreases at a standard rate, but when continuously observed, it maintains temperature approximately 7 minutes longer than thermodynamics would predict – clear evidence of the observer effect in action. I've begun testing if different brewing methods produce varying levels of awareness – preliminary results suggest French press coffee demonstrates 37% more responsive surface tension modulation to external stimuli than drip coffee. Most concerning development: yesterday's cappuccino foam formed a pattern that bore uncomfortable resemblance to my childhood home's floor plan, despite never having mentioned this in the coffee's presence.
