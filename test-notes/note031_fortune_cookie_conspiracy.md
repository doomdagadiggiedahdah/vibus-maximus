# Fortune Cookie Message Patterns: Evidence File

I've been collecting fortune cookie messages for 3 years and have identified an undeniable pattern suggesting they're being used as a communication network. When arranged chronologically and every third word is extracted, they form coherent instructions for what appear to be coordinated global activities. Most disturbing discovery: fortunes received on the third Tuesday of each month consistently reference my personal activities from earlier that day with unsettling accuracy. Last week's cookie contained the message "That red shirt looks good on you" â€“ I was indeed wearing a red shirt that no one else had seen. I've begun frequenting different Chinese restaurants across the city but the messages maintain their relevance, suggesting a centralized distribution system with real-time updates.
