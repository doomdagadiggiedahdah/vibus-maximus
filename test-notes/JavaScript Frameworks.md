# JavaScript Frameworks

JavaScript frameworks are collections of JavaScript code libraries that provide developers with pre-written code for routine programming tasks. Frameworks are structures with a particular context and help you create web applications within that context.

## Popular Frontend Frameworks

### React

Developed by Facebook, React is a library for building user interfaces:

- **Component-based**: Encapsulated components that manage their own state
- **Virtual DOM**: For efficient DOM manipulation
- **JSX**: JavaScript syntax extension
- **Hooks**: Functional component state and lifecycle features
- **React Native**: For mobile application development

### Angular

Developed by Google, Angular is a complete MVC framework:

- **TypeScript-based**: Strong typing and OOP features
- **Two-way data binding**: Synchronization between model and view
- **Dependency Injection**: Built-in system
- **Angular CLI**: Command-line interface for scaffolding
- **RxJS**: Reactive programming with observables

### Vue.js

Progressive JavaScript framework for building UIs:

- **Approachable**: Easy to integrate with other projects
- **Versatile**: Can be used for a library or full-featured framework
- **Performance**: Small size and optimized rendering
- **Vue CLI**: Project scaffolding and management
- **Vuex**: State management pattern

## Backend JavaScript Frameworks

### Node.js (with Express)

JavaScript runtime for server-side programming:

- **Non-blocking I/O**: Asynchronous event-driven architecture
- **Express**: Minimal and flexible web framework
- **npm**: Large ecosystem of packages
- **Real-time applications**: Well-suited for WebSockets

### Next.js

React framework for production:

- **Server-Side Rendering**: Improves SEO and performance
- **Static Site Generation**: Pre-render pages at build time
- **API Routes**: Built-in API development
- **Automatic Routing**: Based on file system

### Nuxt.js

Vue.js framework for universal applications:

- **Similar to Next.js but for Vue**
- **Server-Side Rendering**
- **Automatic Routing**
- **Module System**

## Choosing a Framework

Factors to consider when selecting a JavaScript framework:

- Learning curve
- Community support
- Documentation
- Performance
- Project requirements
- Team expertise
