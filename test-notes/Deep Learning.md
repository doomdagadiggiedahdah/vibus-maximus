# Deep Learning

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers (hence "deep") to analyze various factors of data. Deep learning drives many artificial intelligence applications and services that improve automation, performing analytical and physical tasks without human intervention.

## Neural Networks

Neural networks are the foundation of deep learning, inspired by the human brain:

- **Artificial Neurons**: Process and transmit information
- **Layers**: Input, hidden, and output layers
- **Weights and Biases**: Parameters learned during training
- **Activation Functions**: Add non-linearity (ReLU, sigmoid, tanh)

## Common Architectures

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Excel at image processing
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Handle sequential data
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**: Better at capturing long-term dependencies
- **Transformer**: State-of-the-art for NLP tasks
- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**: Generate new data instances

## Training Concepts

- **Backpropagation**: Algorithm for calculating gradients
- **Gradient Descent**: Optimization algorithm for finding weights
- **Learning Rate**: Controls step size during optimization
- **Overfitting**: Model learns noise in training data
- **Regularization**: Techniques to prevent overfitting

## Applications

- Image recognition and computer vision
- Natural language processing
- Speech recognition
- Autonomous vehicles
- Medical diagnosis
- Game playing (AlphaGo, DeepMind)
