# Houseplant Migration Documentation

My houseplants are definitely changing positions overnight. I've been measuring their exact locations using a laser grid system and each morning at least three plants have moved between 0.7 and 3.2 centimeters from their previous positions. The spider plant appears to be the leader, always moving first and furthest, while the succulents move in a defensive perimeter formation. Most compelling evidence: installed a motion-activated camera that captured what appears to be the fern sliding approximately 1.1 cm between 2:17 AM and 2:19 AM using its root system for locomotion. The plants always maintain the same relative positions to each other, suggesting some form of coordinated movement protocol. They seem to be slowly advancing toward the kitchen â€“ possibly attracted to the water source.
