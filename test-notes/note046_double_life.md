# Evidence For My Double Life Theory

I'm becoming increasingly convinced I'm living a double life I have no conscious memory of. Found unfamiliar restaurant receipts in my pocket from establishments in neighborhoods I've never visited during hours I believe I was asleep. Most compelling evidence: discovered photos on my phone of me at a bowling alley from last Tuesday night – I have no recollection of bowling, yet I'm clearly wearing unusual clothing I don't recognize and appearing to know the other people in the images. The pedometer app logs consistent 3-mile walks occurring between 2-3 AM several times weekly despite my sleeping habits. Most concerning development: received a "great to see you as always" email from someone claiming to be my weekly chess partner for the past 7 months – I don't play chess. Have begun wearing a sleep tracker and setting up night vision cameras to document what appears to be my nocturnal alternate identity.
