# Reverse Archaeology Project: Week 17

My reverse archaeology project continues to yield fascinating results. Instead of digging things up, I bury carefully selected items for future archaeologists to discover. This week I buried a fully functional calculator with all buttons replaced with symbols I invented, a USB drive containing nothing but 10,000 images of spoons, and a waterproof container with my detailed analysis of a fictional civilization that worshipped doorknobs. I've been mapping all burial sites using a coordinate system based on local pigeon population densities. Most exciting development: discovered someone else may be conducting their own reverse archaeology nearby â€“ unearthed what appears to be a deliberately buried collection of meticulously labeled sock puppets during my last excavation.
