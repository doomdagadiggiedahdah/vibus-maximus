# Haircut Personality Alteration Theory

I've documented 17 instances now where individuals undergo subtle but measurable personality shifts following haircuts. My barber shop observation logs confirm that people who lose more than 2.5 inches of hair experience a 40% increase in spontaneous conversation initiation for approximately 72 hours. Most intriguing case: my neighbor transformed from exclusively using passive voice to active voice immediately after getting an undercut. I've been collecting hair samples from salon floors to analyze if different personality traits are stored in different sections of hair follicles. Most concerning development: got my own hair trimmed yesterday and have since developed an inexplicable interest in competitive bird watching and Renaissance-era farming techniques that I've never previously possessed.
