# The Parallel Street Hypothesis

I've discovered a street parallel to my own that doesn't appear on any official maps yet clearly exists. Found it accidentally while chasing a stray cat that disappeared through what appeared to be a solid hedge but was actually a narrow passage. The street perfectly mirrors my own in layout but with subtle architectural differences – all houses are identical to their counterparts but with doors and windows in slightly different positions. Most compelling evidence: the street signs are written in a font that doesn't match any documented typeface, and addresses are displayed using an unfamiliar numbering system based apparently on prime numbers. I've begun cataloging differences between parallel residents and their counterparts on my street – the "parallel me" appears to have chosen a career in marine biology rather than accounting based on the equipment visible through their windows. Most concerning development: left a note in the parallel mailbox belonging to my counterpart and received a response the next day written in what appears to be my exact handwriting but discussing events I have no memory of experiencing.
