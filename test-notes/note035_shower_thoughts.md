# Shower Thought Materialization Experiment

Day 23 of testing my hypothesis that thoughts generated while showering have a 17% higher probability of manifesting in reality. Yesterday's shower contemplation about purple elephants resulted in encountering three separate purple elephant references within 4 hours (store display, random conversation, online ad). Most statistically improbable manifestation so far: idle shower speculation about inventing cucumber-flavored coffee preceded an actual product announcement by exactly 3 days. I've begun systematic testing by thinking exclusively about specific number sequences while showering, then documenting their appearances throughout the day â€“ the number 437 appeared on 11 different receipts after being my shower focus. Have installed a waterproof notebook in shower to improve documentation protocol.
