# Bird Surveillance Operation: Field Notes

The crow population in my neighborhood is definitely conducting organized surveillance operations. I've documented 17 instances where the same three crows have maintained constant line-of-sight observation of my apartment windows in coordinated 4-hour shifts. Most compelling evidence: when I conducted my counter-surveillance test (randomly displaying different colored cards in my window), the lead crow adjusted its position precisely 37 seconds after each color change and made distinct vocalizations that varied by color. The sparrows appear to function as data couriers, making regular trips between crow observation posts and the suspicious van that's been parked two blocks away since March. I've begun wearing different hats to determine if I can confuse their facial recognition capabilities â€“ preliminary results suggest the red beanie effectively reduces crow observation time by 43%.
