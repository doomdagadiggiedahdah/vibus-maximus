# Music Composition for Plant Audience: Session 12

My ongoing project creating avant-garde music specifically composed for plant audiences reached a breakthrough today. During this morning's theremin and wind chime performance, the ficus visibly leaned 7 degrees toward the speaker, and three new buds appeared on the previously dormant orchid. The succulent remains a tough critic, showing no reaction to even my most innovative harmonic structures. Most exciting development: the venus flytrap appears to have developed a clear preference for minor keys and snapped rhythmically during the D minor section. I've begun work on a plant-specific streaming service that adjusts the music based on real-time moisture readings from the soil.
