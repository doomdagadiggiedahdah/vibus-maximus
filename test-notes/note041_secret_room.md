# The Secret Room Investigation

The dimensions of my apartment don't add up – I've measured meticulously and there's a 3.7 square foot discrepancy between the interior measurements and the exterior footprint. The missing space appears to be located somewhere between the bathroom and the kitchen, where the wall sounds hollow but no door is visible. Most compelling evidence: when I press my ear against this section at precisely 3:17 AM, I can hear what sounds like tiny furniture being rearranged. During last month's power outage, a faint light was visible through a pinhole in the baseboard that shouldn't be possible based on the known apartment layout. I've begun sliding notes underneath the baseboard – this morning one had been replaced with a miniature origami crane and what appears to be a property tax bill for the missing 3.7 square feet.
