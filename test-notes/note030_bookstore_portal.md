# Interdimensional Bookstore Theory

I'm increasingly convinced the used bookstore on 7th Avenue serves as a portal to alternate dimensions. Each visit, the layout has subtly changed, with entire sections appearing and disappearing despite the owner insisting nothing has moved. Books I purchase there consistently contain subtle differences from their known published versions â€“ my copy of "Moby Dick" includes an epilogue where Ahab survives and opens a whale-watching tour business. Most compelling evidence: entered at 3:17 PM last Tuesday and exited at 2:45 PM the same day according to my watch, which had also switched from digital to analog display. The elderly cat that roams the aisles has been documented speaking in what I've identified as 17th-century Portuguese, though only when no other customers are within earshot.
