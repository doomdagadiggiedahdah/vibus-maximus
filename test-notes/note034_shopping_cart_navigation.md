# Shopping Cart Navigation Patterns

I've been tracking shopping cart movement patterns at the local supermarket for 37 consecutive shopping trips and have identified what I believe to be naturally occurring algorithms in their navigation. When left unattended, carts consistently drift toward either dairy products or the magazine rack – never any other section. During peak hours, unattended carts demonstrate swarm behavior, clustering in groups of 3-5 near the bakery section. Most compelling evidence: a cart I subtly marked with blue tape has appeared in my checkout lane during 7 separate visits despite being left in different sections each time. I've begun testing if carts have unique personalities by whispering different names to them and measuring responsiveness – "Bartholomew" shows the most consistent directional control so far.
