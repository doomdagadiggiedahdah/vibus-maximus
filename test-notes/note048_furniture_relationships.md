# Furniture Relationship Dynamics Study

My ongoing investigation into the social dynamics between furniture pieces has yielded fascinating insights into their apparent hierarchy and relationship patterns. The coffee table is clearly the dominant piece in the living room, with all other furniture oriented toward it regardless of how I rearrange them overnight. Most compelling evidence: when the bookshelf and armchair are placed too close together, both develop subtle but measurable lean patterns away from each other over 3-7 days, suggesting some form of territorial dispute. The dining chairs demonstrate pack behavior, always returning to symmetrical formation by morning despite being left in disarray. Most concerning development: the newly introduced floor lamp has been systematically excluded by the other furniture – when placed in the center of the room, I consistently find it pushed to the periphery by morning with no explanation. Have begun testing if furniture from the same manufacturer displays stronger affiliative positioning – preliminary results suggest IKEA pieces cluster together while rejecting non-Swedish furnishings.
