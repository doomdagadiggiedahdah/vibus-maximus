# Telephone Pole Network Theory

The telephone poles in my neighborhood are communicating via an undocumented frequency. I've recorded the barely audible humming they emit and when the audio is slowed down 437%, it reveals what sounds like coherent conversations discussing weather patterns and local squirrel migrations. Most compelling evidence: during last week's power outage, the poles continued humming in a pattern that precisely matched Morse code for "temporary interruption, maintain pole integrity." I've mapped the locations of all 37 poles in a three-mile radius and discovered they form a perfect geometric pattern only visible when viewed from exactly 2,173 feet above ground. Most concerning development: the pole outside my window has begun emitting a different frequency only when I'm directly observing it.
