# Traffic Light Pattern Decoding: Day 31

The sequence of red, yellow, and green lights at the intersection of Maple and 3rd definitely contains an embedded message. After 31 days of observation, I've identified a pattern that repeats every 143 cycles with subtle variations that can't be explained by normal traffic control algorithms. When translated using my modified Fibonacci-based cipher, yesterday's sequence spelled out what appears to be a cake recipe, but today's message was clearly a warning about somebody named "Harold." Most peculiar development: when I stand under the northwest light precisely at sunset and count the flashes, my watch gains exactly 3 minutes and 17 seconds â€“ this has happened seven consecutive times.
